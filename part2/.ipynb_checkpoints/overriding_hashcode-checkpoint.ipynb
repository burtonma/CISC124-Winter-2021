    "A fundamental rule that Java programmers must remember is that **the programmer must override `hashCode` in a class whenever `equals` is overridden in that class**.

    "A [*hash function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) is any function that maps information of arbitrary size to a set of fixed-size values. The `hashCode` method should implement a hash function that maps the state of an object (the \"information of arbitrary size\") to an `int` value (the \"set of fixed-size values\"). Hash functions are used by a data structure called a [*hash table*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) that supports constant-time search over the elements in the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hash tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that you an unsorted list of $n$ strings and you want to know if the list contains a particular target string. In Java you would use a loop to search for the string; for example, to search a list `t` for the target string `\"fish\"` you could use the following loop:\n",
    "\n",

    "Of course, you would actually use the `List` method `contains` but that method uses a loop closely resembling the one shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst-case every element of list is compared to the target string using `equals` and the worst-case complexity is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the list. Assuming the target string is always in the list then on average there will be approximately $n / 2$ comparisons using `equals` to find a target string.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash table can be thought of as a list of buckets where each bucket can hold multiple references. Instead of using a linear index to directly access an element, a hash table converts the state of an object to an integer value called a *hash code* and then uses the hash code to access a bucket of the hash table. Unlike a list, a well implemented hash table can search for an element in the hash table in $O(1)$ time complexity. The following video is a brief introduction to how hash tables store and retrieve elements. "

    "        2. If the field is an object reference and this class's `equals` method compares the field by recursively invoking `equals`, recursively invoke `hashCode` on the field. If a more complex comparison is required in `equals`, compute a \"canonical representation\" for this field and invoke `hashCode` on the canonical representation. If the value of the field is `null`, use 0 (or some other constant, but 0 is traditional).\n",
    "        3. If the field is an array, treat it as if each significant element were a separate field. That is, compute a hash code for each significant element by applying these rules recursively, and combine the values per step 2B. If the array has no significant elements, use a constant, preferably 0. If all elements are significant, use `Arrays.hashCode`.\n",

Pre-multiplying `result` by a constant factor ensures that the order in which the fields are considered affects the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The curious reader might also be wondering why multiply by the constant value 31? It turns out that there is no one value that is guaranteed to produce good hash codes in all circumstances but the number 31 [worked well](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4045622) when developing the `String` `hashCode` method and testing the method on words found in an English language dictionary. Another minor benefit is that multiplication by 31 can be done efficiently on many CPUs.\n",

    "  Suppose that you have a class that represents binary numbers having an arbitrary number of bits and that the class defines equality to mean two binary numbers are equal if their decimal values are equal. Note that you cannot use any of primitive numeric types to reliably compute the decimal value of an arbitrary length binary number because such values have at most 64 bits of precision. The class uses a `List` to store the bits of the binary number. How do you define `hashCode` for such a class (for that matter, how do you implement equals?)?"
