    "\n",
    "In Java, almost every *class* is an implementation of a type (the exceptions are abstract classes which are discussed in Part 3 of the notes). When a programmer creates a class, the programmer defines what information is used to represent the type and what operations can be performed by the type. The \"information used to represent the type\" is often called the *data* and the \"operations that can be performed by the type\" is often called the *behaviour*. In Java, the data is represented using *fields* and the behaviour is defined by *methods*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will implement a data structure called a *stack*. The name stack is descriptive of how a stack data structure works. \n",
    "\n",
    "A stack is a collection of elements where the elements can be inserted and removed, but removing an element *always* causes the most recently inserted element to be removed: The stack implements a last-in, first-out or LIFO policy. This implies that a stack keeps its elements in sequence. \n",

    "Java uses *packages* to organize classes and interfaces. Conceptually, a package is similar to a folder or directory on a computer file system. A package has a name (just like a directory has a name). A package can contain another package called a *subpackage* (just like a directory can contain another directory). A package can also contain the names of classes and interfaces (just like a directory can contain files).\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are used to collect together related classes and subpackages. For example, the package `java` contains packages that are part of the Java Standard Edition platform. Inside the package `java` is the package [`lang`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/package-summary.html) that contains packages and classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java programming language. Inside the package `lang` is the package `reflect` that contains classes and interfaces for obtaining information about classes and objects at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *fully qualified name* of a package is (supposed to be) the universally unique name for the package. The fully qualified name of a package that is not inside of another package is simply the name of the package. For example, the fully qualified name of the package `java` is just `java`. If a package is inside of another package, then its fully qualified name is the fully qualified name of its parent package followed by a period `.` followed by the package name. For example, the fully qualified name of `lang` is `java.lang` and the fully qualified name of `reflect` is `java.lang.reflect`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully qualified package names are supposed to be universally unique so that classes having the same name *but are part of different packages* can be used in the same program. For example, suppose that you create your own high performance `String` class and you put your class in the package `my.unique.pkgname`. Then you can use your class and the Java `String` class in the same program by including the fully qualified package name like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String s = \"this is a Java string\";\n",

    "In this example, `my.unique.pkgname.String` is the *fully qualified class name* of the hypothetical high performance string class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately there is no way to enforce the rule that every organization or individual programmer should be using unique fully qualified package names. The convention that is encouraged is that organizations use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their package names. For example, packages and classes created for use in this course might all be grouped into the package `ca.queensu.cs.cisc124`.\n",
