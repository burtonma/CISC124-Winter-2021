    "10. Many practical applications use sampled signals. For example, a digital photograph or image is made up of discrete pixels sampled in space and much modern music is recorded by sampling an audio signal in time. The resulting digital signal is simply an array of values. Upsampling a digital signal by a factor of 2 involves taking the original array of values and inserting a zero value between the individual elements. Then the zeros are replaced by computing some sort of average of the surrounding values. A real-world example of upsampling would be taking a digital image and doubling its width and height. A crude way of replacing an inserted zero is to simply replace the zero with the average of the two elements on either side of the zero. The following cell contains an array `val` representing a signal that we wish to upsample. Create an array `upsamp` that contains the elements of `val` separated by zeros and then replace the zeros with the average of the values on either side of the zeros. The length of the array `upsamp` should be equal to `2 * val.length - 1` because we do not insert a zero before or after the last element of `val`."
