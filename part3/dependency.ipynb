    "> A dependency exists between two elements if changes to the definition of one element (the supplier) may cause changes to the other (the client). With classes, dependencies exist for various reasons: One class sends a message to another; one class has another as part of its data; one class mentions another as a parameter to an operation. If a class changes its interface, any message sent to that class may no longer be valid.\n",

    "We have already seen many examples of dependency relationships between classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* every class `X` that overrides `toString` must return a reference to a `String` object. To create the `String` object the class `X` must use a constructor and methods of the `String` class; therefore, `X` has a dependency relationship with the `String` class.\n",
    "* every class `X` that overrides `equals` must accept a reference to an `Object` object in the `equals` method; therefore, `X` has a dependency relationship with the `Object` class. In fact, every class in Java has a much stronger relationship with the `Object` class (see the [Inheritance: Introduction](./inheritance_introduction.ipynb) notebook).\n",
    "* the `Point2` class has methods that accept `Vector2` references as arguments and return `Vector2` references as return values; therefore, `Point2` has a dependency relationship with `Vector2`.\n",
    "* the `Turtle` class has dependency relationships with the `Point2` class and the pen class that you created because every `Turtle` object has fields. In fact, the `Turtle` class has a stronger relationship to the `Point2` and pen classes (see the [Association, aggregation, and composition](./association.ipynb) notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependency relationship models the \"uses\" relationship between two classes. For example, the `Point2` and `Vector2` classes override the `toString` method which means that they must create and return a new `String` object; therefore, `Point2` and `Vector2` depend on `String`. A dependency relationship can be illustrated using the following diagram:\n",

    "The above diagram is an example of a UML (unified modelling language) class diagram. The classes are represented as boxes with the class name inside the box. A dashed line ending with an open arrow that connects two classes indicates a dependency relationship. A dependency relationship is a directed relationship; the direction that the arrow points indicates the direction of the dependency. The image above illustrates that `Point2` depends on `Vector2` and both `Point2` and `Vector2` depend on `String`.\n",
