    "\n",
    "* we can record the sequence of commands that a turtle has followed by creating and storing objects corresponding to the commands\n",

    "    * recorded sequences makes it possible to undo commands\n",
    "* we can create new commands made up of a compound sequence of commands\n",
    "    * for example, we can create a \"Draw square\" command made up of a sequence of \"walk forward by a distance of x\", \"turn left 90 degrees\", \"walk forward by a distance of x\", \"turn left 90 degrees\", \"walk forward by a distance of x\", \"turn left 90 degrees\", \"walk forward by a distance of x\"\n",
    "* commands can be applied to different turtles\n",
    "    * for example, we can have two or more turtles perform the same sequence of commands\n",

Aggregation conveys the thought that the aggregate is inherently the sum of its parts. In fact, the only real semantics that it adds to association is the constraint that chains of aggregate links may not form cycles... In spite of the few semantics attached to aggregation, everybody thinks it is necessary (for different reasons). Think of it as a modelling placebo.\n",

If the composite object has a method that returns the part field directly, then some other object or class can obtain a reference to `obj` and the composite object can no longer control when the part object is destroyed. Similarly, if the composite object has a method that assigns a parameter directly to a field then the caller of the method has a reference to the part object and the composite object can no longer control when the part object is destroyed.\n",
